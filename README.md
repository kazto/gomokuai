gomokuai
========

A simply Python experiment in heuristic AI. The premise is simple: the user defines the rules of a gomoku game, the AI plays 200 games against itself to learn the best strategy in the user's rule system, and then it's computer v. machine!  

The AI was built was a proprietary heuristic matrix point system. To run, simply pull the directory and run gomoku.py.
